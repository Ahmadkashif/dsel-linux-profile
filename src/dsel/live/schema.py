"""The `metrics.ndjson` record schema (PLAN.md S6).

Every emitter in the build depends on this, which is why it is built early. The
research names `metrics.ndjson` as a bundle artifact and hashes it, but never
defines its record schema; defining it is a primary deliverable.

Design rules:

* **One line, one record, one kind.** A discriminated union on `kind` so a
  reader can dispatch without guessing, and an unknown kind is an error rather
  than a silently ignored line.
* **Every record carries `(t_ms, w, seq)`.** `t_ms` is the sample time, `w` the
  writer shard, `seq` that writer's monotonic counter. The triple is a total
  order, which is what makes a merge of shuffled shards deterministic (S6's
  acceptance criterion) -- wall-clock alone is not, because two writers can
  stamp the same millisecond.
* **Latency here is for watching, never for reporting.** `latency_window`
  carries within-window estimates so the TUI and Grafana have something to draw.
  The authoritative record is the HdrHistogram `.hlog`, and a scrape bucket must
  never become a reported percentile.
