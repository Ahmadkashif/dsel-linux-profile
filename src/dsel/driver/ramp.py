"""The rate ramp (PLAN.md S11).

A ramp runs one offered rate after another and reduces each to a step. **It
does not decide what the steps mean.** Knee, collapse and max sustainable rate
are defined once, in `dsel.phenomena.conn_cliff`, and applied here to steps
held in memory and there to records read from a file. That is what makes S15's
criterion reachable: *an independent script re-derives knee and collapse from
`metrics.ndjson` alone*. Two definitions of a knee would drift, and the
re-derivation would prove nothing.

Each step's cell id carries its offered rate, because the cell id is the
run-matrix coordinate and the rate is one of its axes. A ramp whose steps all
shared a cell id would be unreadable from the metrics file afterwards.

**Cells run serialised.** Two rates in flight at once contend, and the second
would measure the first. The ramp runs one step at a time, in order, and the
order is fixed before it starts.
