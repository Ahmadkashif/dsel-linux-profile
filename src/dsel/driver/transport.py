"""What a worker issues an operation against (PLAN.md S10).

The driver is deliberately ignorant of what it is talking to. PATH A points a
transport straight at an engine, PATH B points it at the app tier, and the
delta between the two is the tier's cost -- which is only a clean subtraction
if the driver above them is identical.

`SyntheticTransport` is not a stub. S11 needs "a synthetic target whose limits
are known by construction" to check that the ramp recovers a knee and a
collapse point, and S10 needs a target whose latency distribution is known
exactly so that a percentile disagreement can only be the histogram's fault.
Its service time is index-derived for the same reason the arrival schedule is:
a rerun reproduces the same target, and a failure can be replayed.
