"""The multi-process worker pool (PLAN.md S10, D6).

One process per worker, started with the `spawn` context so a worker inherits
nothing but its spec -- no partially-initialised connections, no copied random
state, and the same start-up path on macOS and Linux.

The supervisor does three things the workers cannot do for themselves:

* it holds the run's start instant, so every worker's schedule is anchored to
  the same zero and the arrival processes actually superpose;
* it sums the per-worker histograms into the run-level `.hlog` that the audit
  bundle carries. Summing HdrHistograms is exact -- they are counts per bucket
  -- so the aggregate is not an approximation of the workers, it *is* them;
* it decides the cell's verdict. One driver-bound worker makes the cell
  driver-bound: the offered load was not delivered, and averaging that away
  across the other workers would hide it.
